3.1 is Final
presentation is complete and submitted as of 5/4. Work will continue on cleaning up the repository and filling out documentation to record and reflect more on the process and implementation. 

I plan to try to use a different, readable file for the original text documentation, as it has formatting and images. I will likely pull the images out and into a folder as I replace them with more relevant informatiom. 

I also have realized that since I was using comments as my best option for keeping Swing Components Organized, they are not informative at all. This is also undergoing updates.
