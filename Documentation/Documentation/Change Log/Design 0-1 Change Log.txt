•COMPLETELY dumped the code base and started again from just Card Starter files – TB 5/3
	oI was trying to start from what I was considering a “Foundation”, but was really getting it super wrong and starting from Top-Level. That was several days of very arduous and complicated bullshit that I couldn’t even test because it was all in shambles. 
	oNow I’m going to start with the base and poke it until it works, then add a little of what I came up with in the design and test it and repeat the process. In the future, remind me to never, EVER, not take immediate and full command in a group. I tried to politely wrangle everyone and lost 20 days for it. This sucks, even though I am learning a whole lot.

	•Further updates found in Change Log
	•Clean-up of documentation and updates to reflect process between predesign and final build, in regards to the thought process behind re-design
